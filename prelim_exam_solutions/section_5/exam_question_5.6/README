Exam Question 5.6

Write a function called addDict(dict1, dict2) that computes the union of two dictionaries.  It should return a new dictionary containing all the items in both its arguments (which are assumed to be dictionaries).  If the same key appears in both arguments, feel free to pick a value from either.  Test your function by writing it in a file and running the file as a script.  What happens if you pass lists instead of dictionaries?  How could you generalise your function to handle this case too?  Does the order of the arguments passed in matter?
