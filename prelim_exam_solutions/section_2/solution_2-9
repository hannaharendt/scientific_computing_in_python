Question 9:  The following are some of the important concepts in Python's OOP machinery, except:

Answers:

Customizing behavior - redefining methods in subclasses to specialise them
Customizing constructors - adding initialisation logic to superclass steps

Answer to except:

Behaviour methods - encapsulating logic by extending behaviour even outside of class methods

rather than changing or exchanging behaviour or attribute outside of class statements.
