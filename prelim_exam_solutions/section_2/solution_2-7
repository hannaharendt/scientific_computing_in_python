Question 7:  Python provides powerful object types as an intrinsic part of the language.  Here are some reasons why:

Answer:

1.  Built-in objects make programs easy to write

For simple tasks, built-in types are often all you need to represent the structure of problem domains.  
Because you get powerful tools such as collections (lists) and search tables (dictionaries) for free, you can use them immediately.
You can get a lot of work done with Python's built-in object types alone.

2.  Built-in objects are components of extensions

Objects implemented manually are often built on top of built-in types such as lists and dictionaries.
For instance, a stack data structure may be implemented as a class that manages or customises a built-in list.

3.  Built-in objects are a standard part of the language

Although you can implement unique object types in Python, you don't need to do so just to get started.
