Question 2:  A software design concept that wraps up operation logic behind interfaces, such that each operation is coded only once 
             in our program.  That way, we're free to change the single copy's internals almost arbitrarily, without breaking the 
             code that uses it.

Answer:

Encapsulation

In Python, we do this by coding operation on objects in class methods, instead of littering them throughout our program.  
In fact, this is one of the things that classes are very good at - factoring code to remove redundancy and thus optimise 
maintainability.
