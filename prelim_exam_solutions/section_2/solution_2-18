Question 18:  What calls a method, but does not inherit or define it - it expects the method to be filled in by a subclass?

Answer:

Abstract superclass

This is often used as a way to generalise classes when behaviour cannot be predicted until a more specific subclass is coded.  
OOP frameworks also use this as a way to dispatch to client-defined, customisable operations.
