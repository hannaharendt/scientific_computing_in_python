Question in Section 3

Question 1:  Enumerate the 4 class design patterns discussed (and briefly explain each).
Question 2:  Give three advantages in using decorators and briefly explain each.
Question 3:  Match the following class interface techniques with its appropriate description.
Question 4:  What are the two main types of decorators?
Question 5:  Give three (3) critical distinctions that make classes more useful when it comes to building new objects. 
             (manually override marks)
Question 6:  If a name R within the class Person is converted into a pseudo private attribute via name mangling:
             (1)  What is the correct syntax of R to make it a pseudoprivate attribute?
             (2)  How does the Python interpreter change the pseudoprivate attribute to map it locally to its class?  
                  That is, the pseudoprivate attribute is dynamically converted to what expression?
             (3)  What is the translated expression when an instance attribute (let's use the generic term 'self')  
                  references a pseudoprivate attribute?
             (manually override marks) 
Question 7:  Give six (6) examples of core data types in Python (except program unit types, implementation-related types,
             and other core types such as Booleans, types, none).
             (manually override marks)
Question 8:  What are the three major type (and operation) categories in Python?
             (manually override marks)
