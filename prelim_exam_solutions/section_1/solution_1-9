Question 9:  A major rule of thumb in Python is to code for simplicity and readability first and worry about performance later, 
             after your program is working, and after you've proved that there is a genuine performance concern.

Answer:  True

Shouldn't this be the philosophy of programming in general?  More often than not, your code will be quick enough as it is.
