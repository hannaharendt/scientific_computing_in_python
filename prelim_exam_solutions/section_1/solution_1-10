Question 10:  In Python, expressions and built-in functions may work across a range of types, but methods are generally specific 
              to object types - string methods, for example, work only on string objects.

Answer:  True

Methods are simply functions that are associated with particular objects.  Technically, they are attributes attached to objects 
that happen to reference callable functions.
