Question 7:  Because Python is dynamically typed, it requires declaration code to keep track of types.

Answer:  False

The fact that Python is dynamically typed means it keeps track of types for you AUTOMATICALLY instead of requiring declaration code.
However, it is strongly typed (you can perform on an object only operations that are valid for its type).
