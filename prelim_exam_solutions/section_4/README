Questions in Section 4

Question 1:  When does Python consider an object true?
Question 2:  In general terms, when might you choose to use object embedding and composition instead of inheritance?
Question 3: Why is it better to customize by subclassing  rather than copying the original and modifying?
Question 4:  What is the default for the processing mode argument in a file open call?
Question 5:  What's wrong with saying Y = Y.sort()? (Where sort is a list method)
Question 6:  Why is it so important to move processing into methods, instead of hardcoding it outside the class?
Question 7:  What is the difference between a class object and an instance object?
Question 8:  Why is the first argument in a class method function special?
Question 9:  How can you determine how large a tuple is?  Why is this tool located where it is 
             (why is this tool a built-in function and not a method)?
