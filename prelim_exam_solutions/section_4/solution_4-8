Question 8:  Why is the first argument in a class method function special?

Answer:

The first argument in a class method function is special because it always receives the instance object that is the implied subject of the method call.  It's usually called self by convention.  Because method functions always have this implied subject object context by default, we say they are 'object-oriented' - i.e. designed to process or change objects.
