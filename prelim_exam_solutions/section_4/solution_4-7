Question 7:  What is the difference between a class object and an instance object?

Answer:

Both class and instance objects are namespaces (packages of variables that appear as attributes).  The main difference between them is that classes are a kind of factory for creating multiple instances.  Their attributes provide behaviour - data and functions - that is inherited by all the instances generated from them.

Instances represent the concrete items in a program's domain.  Their attributes record data that varies per specific object.
